Simple program used to get an nth line from a file

you can compile this program into a binary, then drop that binary into your 
custom binaries folder (you may need to edit your variable path on your .bashrc file). 

After you start a new session, you can use the command as follows. 
(Assuming you name the binary "line"); 

	line [target line] [target file]

example
 	line 2 somefile.txt
